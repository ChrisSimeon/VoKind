# General

This Application is nothing but a first draft and probably won't work on your comupter without changing the code to work in your specific envirorement.

I won't take any responsibility for any harm caused by this application on your devices and I strongly recommend to not use this application if you don't know exactly what you're doing.

Nethertheless I'm thankful for any input to help me code better.
